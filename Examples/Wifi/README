In order to capture complete WiFi radio frames (w_channels) with wireshark.
First, start wireshark using the menu wireshark->w_channels. Then, force 
reassociation with the access point using:
ifconfig wlan1 down
ifconfig wlan1 up
Wireshark will capture EAPOL frames, required for decrypting next radio frames.
Also, you must enable the IEEE 802.11 decrypt option and precise the password 
and the SSID in the form password:ssid (key), in the field wpa-pwd (key type).
